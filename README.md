Our Journey started a long time ago and, also fairly recent. My whole life, as far back as I can remember. I have always loved dogs. There has not been a time in my life that I have been without a dog for too long. 
In my early 20’s I started to work with dogs professionally. It started at a doggy daycare, then went on to training and grooming. All the while being a huge advocate for rescue, spay and neuter as well as fostering. Working with many animal organizations here in the Pacific northwest, I learned a lot about working in the rescue Industry and what it takes to be a successful animal rescue agency. Now, if there was one thing I know more about than dogs, it would be hair. At 12 years old, I got my first job sweeping hair at my aunt's beauty salon during summer break. I stayed working with my aunt for past high school. Then in 2006 I packed my two dogs up and moved to Portland, Oregon. Now after nearly 2 decades of living here, I am ready to start my dream of having a greater social impact in a positive way by help our furry friends and the people who love them.
